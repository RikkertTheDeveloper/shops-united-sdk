## Installation
For the installation for the application, I will assume that you have [NPM](https://npmjs.com) installed on your machine. To install the package, simply run `npm i shops-united`, this code will install the shops united SDK inside of your project. And you are now ready to start using it.

## Testing The Application

To run the tests in this project, use the `npm run test` command. We've got built-in tests for all the classes related to the library, so you can make sure everything is working smoothly.

When you run `npm run test` , it checks the behavior of each class, making sure they meet the expected specifications. I take testing seriously to ensure the project is solid and reliable, giving you a hassle-free experience when using the library's features.
